    <description>Residential Delivery Indicator (residential or commercial)

Residential — The address is a residential address.
Commercial — The address is a commercial address.
[blank] — This happens when the address is invalid or we don&apos;t have enough information to ascertain RDI status. The SmartyList tools translate a [blank] RDI value to &quot;Unknown&quot;.
Note: For some reason, known only to the US Postal Service, PO Boxes are always marked as &quot;Residential&quot;.</description>
